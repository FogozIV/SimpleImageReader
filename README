Simple App used to generated reduced size image and a weird version of it's binary to be able to read it with "human eyes".


Juste use java -jar ImageSimplifier.jar and some arguments:
-file name_of_file (avoid spaces, put the image extension)
-output name_of_output_file (don't put extension at the end and avoid spaces to)

-width width (will let you decide of the width but isn't a required argument)
-height height (will let you decide of the height but isn't a required argument)

if only height or width is given the initial ratio will be kept.

--nosaveresized will prevent the program to save the resized image
--nosavebin will prevent the program to save the "binary file"

An example of execution:

java -jar ImageSimplifier.jar -file test.jpg -output test_output -width 100 --nosaveresized

This command will read the image file test.jpg resized it to 100 pixel width and then only save it's "binary"
